# CS115-Better-Quiz-App
This is the team repo for my CS115 Project, a Better Quiz App for 
teachers and students. The GrepThink link for this project is 
https://www.grepthink.com/project/better-quiz-app/.

Directions for running the web application: 

1)Navigate to the mysite folder inside the CS115-Better-Quiz-App folder. It is the first mysite folder you see when you open the folder. Make sure you are in the same directory as manage.py
Note: 
There are two mysite folders. The external one is where you run the command from. The command will not run the server if executed from the internal folder.
2)Run the following command: 
python3 manage.py runserver
3)Go to http://localhost:8000/polls/ in your browser, and you should now see the Better Quiz App displaying and running in your browser.
